Introduction: Slime Ascent
---

1:  "Despite the fact that humans gradually ascended from these clustered ponds of ooze, *slime*, as both a general name for a life-generative and semi-solid substance in the physical sense and the disgust of life, the ostensible grossness of organic being in a metaphysical sense, slime remains something to be left behind and forgotten."

> life-as-slime
	
2:  "abandonment of slime [...] the sense that our sliminess can simply be shed over time, evolution as perpetual betterment instead of local adaptation."

2:  "regardless of scientific or other intellectual discoveries it seems that humans must, for the sake of pride or simply life-justification, retain an inherent meaningfulness."

2:  "emergence allows a thing to be more than the sum of its parts."

3:  "Weak emergence implies that the novelty or change observed can be traced to the specific results of its component parts."

3:  "Strong emergence on the other hand suggests a certain irreducibility arising from a system's components."

4:  "slime molds have attracted much attention since they function as both individual cells and multi-cellular organisms."

> Discussing Steven Johnson's *Emergence*, which in turn discusses Toshiyuki Nakagaki's experiments with slime molds.
	
5:  "We must question then what kind of differences are 'real' or what is it about particular species that have real effects versus patterns which only group movements via categories. In other words, the identify of life must be decided, as well as that of un-life."

7:  "human knowledge obtained through observation tends to be contoured by the fact that we think and observe according to our perceptible world and concerns."

8:  "Correlationism is the assertion that there must be a reciprocal relation between thinking and what is thought, that 'there can be no cognizable reality independently of our relation to reality."

> Discussing Meillassoux, citing Brassier, *Nihil Unbound*, 51.
	
8:  "Traditionally vitalism does not seem too different from emergentism in that both suggest that there is something more to life, something that drives and/or affects life that is not purely reducible to the classifiable components of life itself."

8:  "the vital force is time and its effect on space."

11:  "Part of the work of a dark vitalism is the sickening realization of an inhospitable universe, stating that the production of life as an accidental event in time which is then contorted and bent by the banality of space, of our particular (and just as accidental) universal geometry and then further ravaged by accident, context, feedback and the degradation of wear and age."

> Three components of the "dark" of dark vitalism:

11:  First, "because it is obscured both by nature [...] and by time"

11:  Second, "because it spells bad news for the human race in terms of our origin [...] our meaning [...] and our ultimate fate"

11-2:  Third, "on an aesthetic and experiential level our psychological and phenomenological existence is darkened and less friendly to us, and to our perceptions, given the destructiveness of time and space."

12:  "the unnerving spatiality of molds and fungus."

13:  "it is a celebration and liberation of slime in all its disgusting flows."

Chapter 1: The Nightmarish Microbial
---

14:  "we are only an accidental outgrowth as a result of episodic and pointless addition."

14:  "complexity does not imply evolutionary success. Despite our intellectual advantages it is the minuscule that has biological dominion over the earth not only in the exteriorized microorganic nature (the world is out there) but also as that which comprises our own human interiors in terms of the molecular, cellular, and the micro-organic."

15:  "the destructive capacity of life's smallest components are indissociable from its generative capability."

16:  "The virus, the viroid, the deadly bacterium, all crept into center stage prior to the turn of the twentieth to the twenty first century."

16:  "Thus the attention is shifted from the potential horror of viewing the collective biomass of the human race as only viral food, to the demands of our external capabilities found in technology government and reason."

17-8:  "radical openness to other forms of life (viral or otherwise) can begin not with an attitude of openness but with radical closure, that one can be radically open by making oneself a target from the outside paradoxically through isolation."

18:  "Debate still continues over whether viruses are organic compounds (components of life) or forms of life themselves."

19:  "Contagion becomes neither death nor life but protracted life, a state of never quite being dead--an undeadness not of the living dead but of dead living."

19:  Quoting Eugene Thacker, "Cryptobiologies," 3. "Microbes establish networks of infection within a body, and networks of contagion between bodies, and our modern transportation systems extend that connectivity across geopolitical borders."

20:  "Thacker points out that much thinking about the virus centers on the infected body not on the virus itself."

22:  "whereas zombies are reliant on the reduced faculties of their brain pointing towards a target (removal of the head) the necromorphs [from *Dead Space*] must be de-limbed until they can no longer move."

22:  "Biopolitics is the means which governmental entities regulate, or at least attempt to regulate, all aspects of human life (and argably [sic] non-human life) where a philosophy of biology asks what is life in the most generic sense."

22:  "the former [bio-philosophy] thinks the 'peripheries of life' [Thacker] and ontology whereas the latter [philosophy of biology] attempts to think the question of is life and epistemology."

24:  "there is something about life which goes beyond individual forms of life."

24:  "Life has been used conceptually yet the conception of life has no discernible definition."

Chapter 2: Fungoid Horror and the Creep of Life
---

27:  "Beyond the organic, fungus dissolves inorganic structures and is vilified for its damage to manmade ones in particular."

29:  "fungus is representative of death and not another form of life."

30:  "Spores allow fungal life, as an amorphous creep, to extend itself into the vertical and to survive unfavourable conditions as thick walled spheres or as more parasitic entities which germinate inside host creatures or spread from the infected host to further spread again either as an interiority or extended externality."

30-1:  "cryptograms (fungus) appear to feed on nature itself and are considered a lower or simpler form of organism."

32:  "This [sic] fungoid monsters furthermore introduce the uncomfortable notion of plant movement, of the base creepiness of the creep."

33:  "Lovecraft extends biology to terrifyingly vast temporal as well as spatial limits."

34:  "Lovecraft's utilization of the fungal can be seen as attempting an assault on the senses in various modes, appealing to the most base disgust of life, of being an organism (as Ligotti does) as well as portraying the awful pliability of the fungal and the vegetative, as the inevitable creep of life, not as life as always enduring but as always dying, as always being ready to be consumed."

36:  "The production of life requires decay and a clearing away of the biosphere space to make room for new species."

36:  "The stench of death is also the stench of fertilization, of a turning over in the churning teeth of nature."

38:  "[Lovecraft's] Shoggoth [...] questions the purportedly [sic] necessity of a shape to life and to intelligence, to the necessity of a identifiable entity as being something we need to recognize, the suggestion that if something thinks, and even more, if something reasons and is a form of life it must not be a complete assault on the senses."

Chapter 3: Extra-Galactic Terror
---

40:  "The question that remains is what is life, what is the force of life, and what are the forces that act on life. [...] The issue becomes the thinkability of life, thinking life, and the life of thought. [...] how do we define life, what is it about life that allows it to think, and what is the future of thought's rootedness in life."

41:  "The theory of exogenesis holds that life has always already existed and that life on earth has come from elsewhere."

42:  "The result of Lovecraft's mythos is the minimization of the human race, a depressive expansion of the Great Chain of Being where instead of an omnipotent god at one end with humans not far beneath, there is only an ever stretching stream of entities with humanity lost in its perilous contortion."

43:  "Under Lovecraft's indifferentism humans become just another form of matter in the universe, simply another form of entropic fodder in a mechanistic cosmos."

43:  "known widely for his [Ernst Haeckel] recapitulation theory which states that an organism in development went through the developments of the particular species on the whole."

43:  "The important point of Lovecraft's bestiary is not he designated his creatures as not supernatural, but as supernormal, keeping nature in in [sic] all its monstrous capacity."

51-2:  "Dark vitalism accepts a reality that is fundamentally comprised of forces and processes but does not attempt to make this contingency or process-dominated reality something that is immediately thinkable, or understandable within the limits of reason alone. Dark Vitalism then, is a strange combination of realism and vitalism."

Conclusion: Slime Metaphysics?
---

53:  "Freud's speculative biology is pursued in an attempt to explain the tendency of living organisms to repeat unpleasant acts, a repetition which Freud asserts connects the organism's initial division into internal and external components by a massive shock to a drive towards the inorganic."

57:  "a horror inherent to subjective existence. This horror is rooted in the experience of the subject and not organicity itself."

57:  "that life is horrible strictly from the perspective of human beings."

58-9:  "our One is merely the generative material sum as the speculative epoch prior to the Big Bang, the source of all things but in a strictly material sense."

59:  "the One is corrupted or degenerate instead of being transcendent, and instead of being eternal and timeless it is merely the step towards time and space, the possibility of change."

60:  "human beings are merely thinking slime caught in the flow of time, in a parade of nothingness."

60:  "biological existence then, is merely one of the results of this explosion of filth"

61:  "does the base materialism of life relate to the problem of ethics--a concern which too often than not is the center of contemporary philosophy at the cost of analytical or speculative breadth and depth."

61:  "The fundamental challenge of Kantian ethics and of subsequent post-modern ethics (following from thinkers such as Emanuel Levinas) is that they set themselves as groundless, as not following from any sort of nature or material substance. This groundlessness is only half-hearted however, as the dominant form of ethics bases itself on an unacknowledged (or celebrated) positing of the importance of human beings."

66:  "The face that we have evolved self-consciousness should not guarantee or maintain meaning. Meaning is only ever the final gloss on being which when removed does not then dictate mass suicide nor pure apathy."

67:  "The material being of humans, and of all life is a slimy one. Slime is the smudge of reality, the remainder and the reminder of the fact that things fall apart."
