Introduction
---

1:  "The farm was a living petri dish for new viruses, bringing together birds, pigs, and humans in close proximity--a perfect breeding ground."

2:  "To cause that kind of damage to the human population, a flu virus has to combine two traits: lethality and transmissibility. The more optimistically minded scientists argued that one trait precluded the other [...] The optimists we found out last fall [2011], were wrong."

2:  "Flu is an excellent example of how we have, through our technologies and our dominant presence on the planet, begun to multiply the risks to our own survival."

2-3:  "Yet if anything the existential dangers have only multiplied since the end of the Cold War. Today the technologies we fear are not so much military as commercial. They come from biology and the information sciences, and they are behind our prodigious productivity. They are far more seductive than nuclear weapons, and more difficult to extricate ourselves from. The technologies we worry about today are the ones that form the basis of our global civilization and are essential to our survival."

3:  "To fight these pathogens, we are racing to uncover mysteries at the chemical heart of biology, as we should, but at the same time we're opening new possibilities for mischief." *as we should*? Surely this needs some explanation and justification.

4:  "The most terrifying monsters are the ones that we have created with our technology and our dominance of the planet."

4:  "Because the world is unpredictable, it's a good exercise to consider the worst case. It forces us to think about where we fit into the world and ask where we stand in relation to the history of life on Earth."

4-5:  "Optimism, I've come to believe, is an outlook, a state of mind that is partly reason and emotion, partly a product of personality. I tend toward the techno-optimistic side of the spectrum. I also think optimism is our best weapon. There's no going back on our reliance on computers and high-tech medicine, agriculture, power generation, and so forth without causing vast human suffering--unless you want to contemplate reducing the world population by many billions of people."

Chapter 1: Superviruses
---

13:  "For this reason [delay in producing vaccines], a flu virus doesn't need to kill 100 percent, or even 90 percent, of its victims to be devastating. A new influenza virus with a 60-percent mortality rate--a rate that some virologists contend is entirely possible and would be consistent with the known rate of mortality from bird flu--could, if it struck without warning, conceivably result in hundreds of millions of deaths."

13:  "We are surrounded by influenza viruses that live in birds, and this reservoir poses a constant threat to humans."

16:  "An influenza virus particle works much like a hijacker--by breaking and entering a human lung cell and taking over. It's a delicate and complex operation. The virus first has to enter the lungs on a current of air. It has to penentrate the membrane of a lung cell and inject its genetic material. It has to insert itself into the cell's genetic machinery, altering the cell's biochemical clockwork so that instead of performing all the day-to-day tasks of staying alive, it starts manufacturing copies of the virus. When that job is done, the virus particles collect in the lungs, ready to go out like shock troops when the victim sneezes and find another victim, and the cycle starts anew."

20:  "virologists can't tell, even if they sequence a virus's genome, whether it's going to be a lion or a pussycat."

23-4:  "Every health department of every major city, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Pentago, has a document it hopes never to have to dust off. It is the called the Mass Fatality Plan. It outlines what would need to be done in the event of a disaster such as the next killer influenza epidemic. It assesses the 'surge capacity' of local hospitals--how many beds are typically available, how many could be made available by sending some patients home and postponing elective surgery. The New York City area, for instance, has a limited supply of respirators--devices to help people with fluid in their lungs to breath, which would be essential in a flu emergency. In a 1918-style flu pandemic, these respirators would be at a premium, and hospitals would be forced to ration their use. That means many people would have to be left to drown as their lungs filled up with fluids."

24:  "They would have to stay at home, since hospital beds would also quickly be filled up. A surge in influenza intakes would quickly overwhelm the nation's hospitals. Currently there are just under a million hospital beds in the nation. Most hospitals operate at about two-thirds capacity--which comes to roughly three hundred thousand extra beds. An influenza outbreak that sickened 1 percent of the nation at once would use up all spare capacity. (That's assuming, of course, that these beds are distributed uniformly, which of course they aren't.) If 10 percent of the population marched into emergency rooms, there would be pandemonium."

Chapter 2: Extinction
---

31:  "Sometimes, though, change happens all at once, too quickly for species to adapt. Many biologists believe that is happening now. They believe that human species are changing the planet at a rate too quick for many of the planets' species to keep up. Eventually they fear, species will die off suddenly en masse, triggering a cascade of extinctions, which could have a devastating effect on the planet's intricate web of life. [...] It's nature's way of wiping the slate clean to begin again. It's happened at least five times since life began on the planet about 4 billion years ago."

33-4:  "The meteorite impact was huge. It would have been visible in the sky as a bright star days and perhaps weeks before impact. Had it happened tomorrow, NASA scientists might alert us to the event a few weeks ahead of time, calculate the trajectory of the object, and demand an audience with the president and go on talk shows and news programs in a campaign to get funding for an anti-asteroid program. Perhaps, if we were really lucky, the NASA folks would have gotten a bead on the meteor a few months ahead of time, giving us at least a prayer of launching a nuclear-tipped missile that might have been able to break up the meteor into smaller parts that would fall relevatively harmlessly in the atmosphere, or knock it off course enough to miss Earth. U.S. Congress mandated in 2005 that NASA find nine of every ten asteroids that could strike Earth and do some damage, so that we could perhaps have years of warning before a potential impact and prepare a plan for dealing with one. But with a measly $4 million budget, NASA's asteroid watch is likely to fall short."

36:  mass extinction events--65 MYA, 252 MYA, 600 MYA, 2,400 MYA

37:  "more than 90 percent of all the species on the planet died off about 251 million years ago."

39:  "In the past few years, however, they have narrowed the Permian event to less than two hundred thousand years--a veritable New York minute--based on close cross-correlation with the myriad fossils found throughout the world. Erwin says it is possible that the extinction event happened in a few tens of thousands of years, but there is no way to know that from the fossil evidence. That may not seem quick, but it brings the duration of the event into a time period with human significance. Agriculture began ten thousand years ago; one hundred thousand years ago *Homo sapiens* began its migration out of Africa."

42:  "If we are the second [species], then what was the first? The Great Oxidation Even, 2.4 billion years ago, is also a case of an organism changing the world's chemistry in profound ways, threatening the lives of other creatures around it. The villain is a little creature called the cyanobacterium. Also known, colloquially, as pond scum."

44:  "Today we're the pond scum, pumping out not oxygen but carbon dioxide, filling up the oceans and the atmosphere, geochemically transforming the planet."

45:  "When we talk about the Holocene extinction event, what time scale do we use? Climate scientists tend to date the beginning of human impact on climate at the start of the industrial revolution around about 1850, and when they spin their climate models into the future, they'll often refer to how things may be in 2050, or at the end of the century."

45:  "Human activity, of course, amounts to more than simply carbon emissions. You could argue that our impact on the planet began one hundred thousand years ago when *Homo sapiens* migrated out of Africa and eventually replaced Neanderthals and *Homo erectus* as the dominant hominid species. Or you could argue that the start of agriculture about ten thousand years ago was the true beginning of our transformation."

49:  "How far has the Holocene extinction gone? It's hard to know, not least because nobody knows how many species existed in the first place. Between 1.5 million and 1.8 million species have been named, but 100 million or so may not have been discovered. Based on the area of habitat lost, estimates put the number of extinctions at 140,000 species per year, but there is no figure that everyone agrees on."

Chapter 3: Climate Change
---

55-6:  "The idea that climate behaves like a dynamical system addresses some of the key shortcomings of the conventional view of climate change--the view that looks at the planet as a whole, in terms of averages. Scheffer's dynamical systems approach, by contrast, would look at climite as a sum of many different parts, each with its own properties, all of them interdependent in ways that are hard to neglect."

58:  "If we burn all the available coal and oil, the Venus effect is likely, and if we also burn other sources of fossil fuels, such as tar sands and tar shale, says Hansen, 'I believe the Venus syndrome is a dead certainty.'"

59-60:  "Climate, for instance, is not one thing that covers the globe. It is a sum of weather patterns and ocean circulations and storms and droughts and clouds. It starts on an astronomical level, with the Earth's orbit varying as it goes around the sun. The orbit itself tends to vary slightly in several ways; sometimes it traces more of a circle around the sun, sometimes more of an ellipse. This affects the relative amount of radiation falling on the Earth throughout the year. Right now, Earth gets about 6 percent more energy from the sun in January than it does in July. But when the orbit is at its most elliptical, that differential climbs to 20 or 30 percent. This eccentricity varies in one-hundred-thousand-year cycles. The tilt of the Earth on its axis tends to vary, too, every forty-one thousand years or so, and affects the contrast between the seasons and the ease with which glaciers can form. Earth also wobbles on its axis, much as a top wobbles as it begins to slow down, which imposes another twenty-three-thousand-year cycle."

60:  "A big factor is ice. Ice on the ground is white, which reflects sunlight and heat energy back into space. This 'positive feedback' reinforces whichever trend is already under way. More ice reflects more sunlight, which makes a cold Earth even colder. By the same token, when ice melts, it exposes the ground or water beneath it, which tends to absorb more energy and turn it into heat, thus reinforcing a warm planet's tendency to get even warmer."

72:  "At such a rate of sea-level rise, it would become more and more difficult to protect coastlines. Low-lying areas would have to be abandoned. That includes cities such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, not to mention the entire state of Florida and vast swaths of Indochina."

72:  "Researchers in Germany and Holland recently spun out scenarios of what a five-meter rise in the next century would mean. The seas would inundate many low-lying areas. Much of Florida would disappear, large areas around the North Sea, including Holland, and major deltas in Asia. The Nile River would rise and flood the delta, putting parts of the city of Alexandria underwater. The waters of the Mekong River would rise and consume its delta. Many rivers that run through major cities would back up due to the rising sea and necessitate the building of barriers or the abandonment of low-lying areas."

73:  "It would take time for the government to act because governments are inherently slow, even the small Dutch government."

Chapter 4: Ecosystems
---

Despite arguing that ecosystems are like complex networks, continues to use the language of hiearchy--"top of food chain," "bottom of food chain," etc.

89:  "The way our food economy works now is diametrically opposed to the way the Sanak hunter-gatherers' food economy worked. When a source of food becomes scarce, such as caviar or truffles, we tend not to switch to another more plentiful food item. Instead, we bid up the price and redouble our efforts to produce or harvest more. Rather than make use of a variety of food types, we specialize on only a few, because that's what it takes to achieve economies of scale, drive down the price, and feed more people. Our modern economy engages in the opposite of prey switching."

91:  "But the Green Revolution has also put us out on something of a limb. It has led to a vast global agricultural industry that is overdependent on only a few strains of four major crops--wheat, soy, rice, and corn."
