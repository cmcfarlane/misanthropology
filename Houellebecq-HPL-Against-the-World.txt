Michel Houellebecq. H.P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life. With an Introduction by Stephen King. Translated by Dorna Khazeni. Believer Books: 2005[1991].

24:	``his absolute materialism'' and ``obsessive racism'' (the source of which is ``found in *real* human beings,'' especially his stay in the slums of New York where he encountered other races close at hand---and lost to them). The ``essential and profound core'' of racism is ``*fear*''.

29. ``Life is painful and disappointing. It is useless, therefore, to write new realistic novels. We generally know where we stand in relation to reality and don't care to know any more. Humanity, such as it is, inspires only an attenuated curiosity in  us.''

33.	``It is possible, in fact, that beyond the narrow range of our perception, other entities exist. Other creatures, other races, other concepts and other minds. Amongst these entities some are probably far superior to us in intelligence and in knowledge. But this is not necessarily good news. What makes us think that these creatures, different as they are from us, will exhibit any kind of *spiritual* nature? There is nothing to suggest a transgression of the universal laws of egotism and malice. It is ridiculous to imagine that at the edge of the cosmos, other well-intentioned and wise beings await to guide us toward some sort of harmony. In order to imagine how they might treat us were we to come into contact with them, it might be best to recall how we treat `inferior intelligences' such as rabbits and frogs. In the best of cases they serve as *food* for us; sometimes also, often in fact, we kill them for the sheer pleasure of killing. This, Lovecraft warned, would be the true picture of our future relationship to those other intelligent beings. Perhaps some of the more beautiful humans would be honored and would end up on the dissection table---that's all.''

39.	``Paradoxically, Lovecraft's character is fascinating in part because his values were so entirely opposite to ours. He was fundamentally racist, openly reactionary, he glorified puritanical inhibitions, and evidently found all `direct erotic manifestations' repulsive. Resolutely anticommercial, he despised money, considered democracy to be an idiocy and progress to be an illusion. The word `freedom,' so cherished by Americans, prompted only a sad, derisive guffaw. Throughout his life, he maintained a typically aristocratic, scornful attitude toward humanity in general coupled with extreme kindness toward individuals in particular.''

57. ``Absolute hatred of the world in general, aggravated by an aversion to the modern world in particular. This summarizes Lovecraft's attitude fairly accurately.''

59.	``HPL's writings have but one aim: to bring the reader to a state of *fascination*. The only human sentiments he is interested in are wonderment and fear. He constructs his universe upon these and these alone.''

61.	``Obscurely and unpleasantly, there is also the fact that a novelist tackling the subject of life in general will necessarily discover himself to be more or less compromised by it. This was not a problem Lovecraft experienced. One might well object that the very realities, `animal biology,' that so bored him play an integral part in human existence, and that they in fact let the species survive. But he could not have cared less about the survival of the species.''

67.	``The world stinks. The stench of cadavers and of fish blends together. A sense of failure, a hideous degeneration. The world stinks. There are no ghosts under the tumescent moon; there are only bloated cadavers, swollen and black, about to explode in pestilential vomiting.
	``As for the sense of touch. To touch other beings, other living entities, is an impious, repugnant exercise. Their skin bloated with blisters that ooze putrid pus. Their sucking tentacles, their clutching and chewing appendages, all constitute a constant menace. Beings and their hideous corporeal vigor. A simmering, stinking Nemesis of semi-aborted chimeras, amorphous and nauseating: a sacrilege.
	``Sight at times delivers terror, but can also transport us before wondrous faeric architecture. But, alas, we do have five senses. And the others converge to prove that the universe is something decidedly *disgusting*.''
	
79.	``The style of scientific reporting adopted by HPL in his later stories operates according to the following principle: *the more monstrous and inconceivable the events and entities described, the more precise and clinical the description*. A scalpel is needed to dissect the unnameable.''

79-80.	``If distant entities that are several hundred million years old appear in the course of human history it is vital to document the exact moment of their appearance. Each is a point of rupture. To allow the unutterable to erupt.''

101.	``But there was nothing at all. No matter what the remuneration, his applications were of no interest to no one. He was inadaptable to the market economy. And he began to sell his furniture.''

102.	``Here are the first hints of the racism that later nourishes HPL's body of work. It appears in a most banal form: unemployed, threatened by poverty, Lovecraft had more and more trouble tolerating the hard and aggressive urban environment. Furthermore, he began to feel bitterness towards immigrants of diverse origins, who we saw blending easily into the swirling *melting pot* that was America in the 1920s, while he himself, in spite of his pure Anglo-Saxon origins, was unable to find any work.''

103.	``New York had marked him forever. During the course of 1925, his hatred of the `foul mongrels' of this modern Babylon, the `foreign colossus that gibbers and howls vulgarly...' did not cease to exasperate him and drove him delirious. It could even be posited that a fundamental figure in his body of work---the idea of a grand, titanic city, in whose foundations crawl repugnant nightmare beings---sprang directly from his New York experience.''

104.	``from the swamps of Louisiana to the frozen plateaus of the Antarctic desert, in the very heart of New York and the in the somber vales of Vermont's countryside, everything proclaims *the universal presence of evil*.''

112.	``In general, Lovecraft's mythology is very original, but at times it appears to be a frightful inversion of Christian themes. This is particularly the case in `The Dunwich Horror,' in which an illiterate peasant woman who has known no men gives birth to a monstrous creature endowed with superhuman powers. This inverted incarnation ends with a repugnant parody of the Passion where the creature, sacrificed at the summit of a mountain that overlooks Dunwich, cries out desparately, `*Father! Father! YOG-SOTHOTH!*' in a faithful echo of `*Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani*.' Here, Lovecraft goes back to a very ancient source of horror where Evil is the product of a carnal union against nature. This idea fits his obsessive racism perfectly; for, to him, as to all racists, it is not one particular race that represents true horror, but the notion of the half-breed. Using both his knowledge of genetics and his familiarity with sacred texts, he concocts an explosive synthesis of abject, unprecedented force. To Christ, the new Adam come to regenerate mankind, Lovecraft opposes the `negro' who has come to regenerate humanity through bestiality and vice.''

113.	``life is itself evil.''

116.	``Horror writers are reactionaries in general simply because they are particularly, one might even say *professionally*, aware of the existence of Evil. It is somewhat curious that among Lovecraft's numerous disciples none has been struck by this simple fact: the evolution of the modern world has made Lovecraftian phobias ever more present, ever more *alive*.''
